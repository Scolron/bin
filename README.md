# Scripts

The following are scripts I have written for myself.

# newproject

New project will create a new directory with all the things I normally use. For
example, the script will make a README.md file, and a file formatted for the
programming language specified.  The script can also initialize a git.

This script is assumed to be store in `~/.bin/` with the directory Documents
which is also in this repository. I am using Vim 8 with You Complete Me. If you
are not using this, there will be extra files in your c/c++ project files. 

## newproject_test

A script to make sure that all functions work as desired. It is not intended
for others to use.
